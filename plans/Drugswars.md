# Drugwars Implementation Plan

## **1. Core Concept**

-   Each player gets a **private game channel** created by the bot.
-   The bot only **responds to the channel owner** and ignores messages from other users.
-   Players can **buy/sell drugs, travel, manage money, and hire employees**.
-   Random **police raids, market fluctuations, and interactions with other players** enhance gameplay.
-   Players can **tip off the police** to raid competitorsâ€™ operations.

---

## **2. Key Features**

### **2.1 Private Game Channels**

-   When a player starts a game, a **private text channel** is created under a "Drugwars" category.
-   Only the **player and bot** can send and view messages.
-   If another player types in the channel, the bot ignores them.
-   If a player already has a game channel, they are directed back to it instead of creating a new one.

---

### **2.2 Drug Market System**

-   Drug prices fluctuate based on **supply and demand**, as well as random events.
-   Certain locations offer better prices for specific drugs.
-   Occasionally, there are **price surges or crashes**.
-   A **black market** can provide rarer drugs but at higher risk.

---

### **2.3 Employees & Operations**

-   Players can **hire employees** to automate parts of their business:
    -   **Dealers:** Sell drugs on the streets for passive income.
    -   **Mules:** Transport drugs between cities with a risk of being caught.
    -   **Enforcers:** Protect the operation from police or rival players.
    -   **Accountants:** Reduce tax investigations and money laundering risks.
-   Employees require **payment and upkeep**, and their effectiveness varies based on experience.

---

### **2.4 Police Raids & Player Tipping**

-   **Police raids** occur randomly, especially when:
    -   A player has too much **heat** from selling large amounts.
    -   A rival player **tips off the police** about their operation.
    -   The player is in a **high-crime area**.
-   Players can **tip off the police** on another playerâ€™s operation in exchange for rewards or reduced heat.
-   If the police raid a playerâ€™s operation, they may:
    -   Lose drugs and money.
    -   Have their **employees arrested**.
    -   Need to **bribe** their way out of trouble.

---

### **2.5 Travel System**

-   Players can **travel between different locations**.
-   Each location has unique **drug prices, crime rates, and law enforcement activity**.
-   Some locations are safer but offer **lower profits**, while others are riskier but more lucrative.
-   Traveling carries **a chance of police searches**, which depends on:
    -   Amount of drugs being carried.
    -   Type of **vehicle** (car, boat, private jet, etc.).
    -   Whether the player has **corrupt officials on payroll**.

---

### **2.6 Economy & Banking**

-   Players can store money in a **bank** to avoid losing it in raids.
-   Banks have **withdrawal limits and fees**.
-   **Loan sharks** offer quick cash, but failing to repay can result in **consequences**.

---

### **2.7 Player Interactions & Rivalries**

-   Players can **tip off the police** on others.
-   Rival players can **steal, sabotage, or form alliances**.
-   A leaderboard tracks **top dealers**, showing net worth, drug sales, and arrests.
-   Future updates could include **co-op drug empires**, where players work together.

---

## **3. Deployment & Expansion**

-   Hosted on a **VPS or Docker** for stability.
-   Uses a **database** (SQLite, MongoDB) to store progress.
-   Future expansions could include:
    -   **Weapons & turf wars** for territory control.
    -   **Undercover cops** trying to bust operations.
    -   **Multi-city trade routes** for larger-scale operations.

This plan ensures **engaging gameplay, risk-reward mechanics, and social interaction**, making Drugwars a competitive and evolving experience on Discord. ðŸš€
